# Java Spring Boot Projects

This repository contains implementations of **Java Spring Boot projects**, covering various small-to-medium scale applications.  
The goal is to showcase classical and modern strategies applied to real-world and educational projects.


## Topics Covered

- **Web Applications (MVC)**  
  Implementing projects with Spring Boot MVC architecture using `@Controller` and Thymeleaf views.  
  Examples include:
  - Calculators
  - Contact management systems
  - Form-based data processing

- **REST APIs**  
  Creating RESTful services with `@RestController` to handle JSON requests and responses.  
  Examples include:
  - CRUD APIs for user management
  - Calculation services
  - Data retrieval APIs

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Thymeleaf** (for MVC projects)
- **Bootstrap 5** (optional for UI styling)
- **Maven** (for dependency and build management)
- **Optional libraries**: Lombok, H2 Database, Spring Data JPA

## Project Goals

This repository serves as:

- **An educational resource**: for learning Spring Boot, MVC, REST, and web development in Java.
- **An experimentation base**: for extending or adapting projects to research, learning, or real-world applications.
- **A documented collection**: of small to medium Java Spring Boot projects with well-commented examples.

## Upcoming Work

- Add more REST API projects and full-stack integrations.
- Include authentication and authorization examples (Spring Security).
- Integrate persistent storage (e.g., MySQL, H2) for selected projects.
- Add unit and integration tests for the projects.
